# Useful Roblox resources
I've been browsing the DevForum lately as there are many awesome resources that I can use for my personal projects. I thought that I can share them here so you don't have to search those awesome resources by yourself. Make sure to credit them somewhere on your game (even if the developer didn't ask to) as an appreciation for making such amazing resources!

> Some of these resources has GitHub repo, be sure to read the license before putting them into your game!

## Resources
| Resource | Developer | Description | Notes |
|:----|:----|:----|:----|
| [BetterChat](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/1756348) | [Jumpathy](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/Jumpathy) | An feature-rich chat system that supports rich text, message editing, and alot more! | If you don't like Roblox's default chat, use this one. I'd guarantee that you'll like it! |
| dat.GUI ([DevForum thread](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/817209), [GitHub repo](https://github.com/nidorx/roblox-dat-gui)) | nidorx ([DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/nidor_x), [GitHub](https://github.com/nidorx)) | A lightweight GUI and controller library. | Useful if you want to make simple settings or something similar. If you only need sliders, checkboxes, use RbxGuiLib instead. |
| RbxGuiLib ([DevForum thread](https://devforum.roblox.com/t/719287), [GitHub repo](https://github.com/EgoMoose/Rbx-Gui-Library)) | EgoMoose ([DevForum](https://devforum.roblox.com/u/EgoMoose), [GitHub](https://github.com/EgoMoose)) | Another GUI library that you can use to make few common GUI (like slider bars, checkboxes, you name it) components tht didn't present in Roblox. | There are no documentation on the thread, but you can read them on the source code itself. |
